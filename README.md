String generator that displays all possible variants of character combination taken from entered word/symbols (W.I.P.)

**Example**:

User enters "ab" and then lenght of maximum string combination. The program will take all the characters from the string and will generate all string combinations in ascending order.

```txt
User input: ab
Maximum lenght: 2
a
b
aa
ab
ba
bb
```

## How to run

```txt
gcc string_gen.c
```

then

```txt
compiled file > out.txt
```

gen.txt can be any file you want to store output.
